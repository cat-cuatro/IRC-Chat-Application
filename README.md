# IRC-Chat-Application
Two separate components:

Just an IRC Project for PSU 494P. See the RFC documentation if you're truly that curious.
Code for this project likely won't be maintained after this course.

Couldn't get asynchronous chatting to work. Messages are sent, but the socket's buffer is always a message behind due to I/O blocking.
